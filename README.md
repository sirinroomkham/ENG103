# ENG103 Repository

Welcome to the **ENG103** tutorial repository. This repository is designed to help you get started with your weekly activities and project work. The course involves using Raspberry Pi and other hardware components discussed during class sessions.


## Purpose of the Repository

This repository contains tutorials and support materials that will guide you through:

- Completing your **weekly activities**.
- Working on your **course project**.
  
Make sure to explore the scripts and exercises provided here, and customize them as necessary to fit your own project requirements.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi** (or compatible hardware)
- **Python 3.x**
- Additional hardware components as discussed in class (e.g., sensors, GPIO pins).

## Getting Started

To follow along with the tutorials and run the scripts provided in this repository, you should be familiar with:

- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: You’ll frequently need to use terminal commands to interact with the Raspberry Pi.
- **Python Scripts**: Many of the activities will involve running Python scripts on the Raspberry Pi. Make sure you know how to execute Python scripts and modify them to suit your needs.

## How to Use the Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Download the repository to your Raspberry Pi (or computer) using the following command:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sirinroomkham/ENG103.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository Folder**:
   Change into the directory:
   
   ```bash
   cd ENG103
   ```

3. **Running the Python Scripts**:
   To run the provided Python scripts, use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

   Replace `script_name.py` with the actual script you want to run.

## Customizing the Scripts

Feel free to customize the scripts to fit your project or activity needs. The code is meant to be adapted to your specific use case, whether that’s controlling hardware, logging data, or interacting with sensors.

## Additional Notes

- **Stay up to date**: Make sure you are familiar with any updates to the materials provided in this repository.
